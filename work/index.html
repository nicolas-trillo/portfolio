      <h2>Some of my work</h2>
      <p>
        I can code in HTML, CSS, JS, Swift, Python, and a bit of C. Here's some
        of the work I've made using HTML, CSS and Swift, mainly.
      </p>
      <h4>The GTarquitectos website</h4>
      <p>
        <br />
        I made this website to help showcase my dad's work. It is the most
        complex site I've put together. <br />
        Did I get paid for it? No. Did I enjoy making it? Hell yeah.<br /><a

          >Visit it!!</a

      </p>
      <h4>The TEDxYouth@Yanahuara website</h4>
      <p>
        <br />
        I built this website with the objective of it being the face of the
        biggest challenge I've ever faced: My TEDx conference.
        <br />
        It was fun, I met the most amazing people from my city and learned
        plenty from them. I really liked how the whole thing turned out, and I
        think the website ended up being beautiful.
        <br />
        About the event itself, it took place on the 23rd of December 2022,
        after it was delayed several times due to the violent crisis that hast
        stormed Peru since the ex-president attempted his failed coup d'état.
        <br />

      </p>
      <h4>(This website, haha)</h4>
      <p>Pretty much describes itself and its purpose, no?</p>
      <h4>The ThreeCalc App</h4>
      <p>
        <br />
        ThreeCalc started off as an experiment of mine, which I showed to some
        friends, and they suggested I fully developed the idea. 
        <br />
        I finished it around August 2022, and I plan to publish it on the App
        Store within the next few months. The app is really just a
        direct/indirect proportion calculator, with the option to adjust the
        decimal places up to 16. I find it handy on my every day, and I hope
        many others will do too.
        <br />

          >See a video of its function</a
        >
      </p>
      <p class="text-secondary">
        Worth noting, I have built other things like small WebApps, but I deem
        them to not be interesting enough to talk about them here.
